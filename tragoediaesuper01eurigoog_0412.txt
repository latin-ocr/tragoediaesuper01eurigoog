lm ANNOTATIONES

Polynices, are on the stage together from v. 1249 to v. 1446.
But it is to he ohserved that Ismene is not only mute during

the presence ol Polynices, but that, io this part of the play,
she does not speak a word hom her entrance to her exit. The

poet was st liberty to employ as many mutes as he thought
proper. Perhaps this note may appear somewhat long, and
rather irrelevant. We can only say, that the type is small,
and that the French cn'tics, in their interpretation of the Noc
φωνῶ locro persona laboret of Horace, have omitted to point
out the (aigin ol that rule. ELMS. in Quarterlp Πανίου
vol. 7. p. 449. The Quarterly Reviewer's observatione on this
subject had been in a great measure anticipated· by Tyrwhitt,
in his commentary on Aristotle on Poetry(sect.10.). Tyr-
whitt points out a scene in the Choephovi os AEschylus, where
only thirteen verses (887-889.) are interposed between two
speeches which are spoken by the same actor, in two different
characters. In the same manner, the actor, who represents
Ulysses in the Rhesus, leaves the stage after v. 626, and re-
turns in the character of Paris before v. 642. It appears frorn
these instances, that the recitation of twelve nr fifteen trimeter
iambics allowed an actor sufficient time to retire, to change his
dress, and to return. Neither Tyrwhitt nor the Reviewer has
noticed the scene in the Andromache ol Euripides (v. 546.),
in which Peleus enters and interrupta a conversation between
Andromache, Molossus, and Menelaus. Here are evidently
four actovs on the stage at the same. time, although Molossus
does not open his lips after the entrance os Peleus. Molossus,
however, is a young child, and it is probable that young chil-
dren did not fall within the rigour ol the law. Il the reader
will forgive us l'or making a pun, which is suggested to us by
dire experience, we will venture to compare the rules of the
Athenian stage, with those of the Kensington stage, in which
three men, three women, and three children, are counted for
only six possengers. Although this system of arithmetic does
not add to the comfort of the Kensington stage, it produced
some advantage on the Athenian stage. As the same actor
cannot perform the parts ol a little boy or girl, and ola full-
grown man or woman, it would have been impossible, if the
indulgence of which we are speaking had not been allowed, to
put a few words into the mouth of n child, without giving up
