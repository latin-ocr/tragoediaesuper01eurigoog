AD SUPPLICES. 401

the convenience of a third actor for the adult characters. ln
the tragedy before us, for instance, if this licence had been
withheld, the poet would have been compelled, either to omit
the dialogue between the mothers and the children of the
deceased captains (vv.1123-1163.), orto arrange the first
part of the play in such amanner, as tc prevent Theseus and
Adrastus from being on the stage at the same time with
AEthra, and afterwards with the Theben herald. ‘ We hope
here be facts! We must acknowledge, however, that we have
observed other facts, which do not quite so well accord with
our hypothesis. The Medea and thc Alcestis cl Euripides
are the only other Greek tragedies in which children speak.
There are two children in the Medea, but as they speak from
behind the scenes, both parts, which contain only four lines
(vv. 1271. 1272. 1277.1278.), might be given to the same
performer. Now it is very remarkable, that the Medea and ¹
the Alcestis are the only plays of Euripides, in which a third
actor is not required for the representation ol the adult cha-
racters. Il the render will examine these two plays atten-
tively‚ he will perceive that the contrivances‚ which are adopted ¹
in most cases lor the purpose ol rendering a fourth actor un-
necessary, are applied in these two pieces to the exclusion ol a
third actor. In the Medea, if we assign the part of Medea,
and tlte partos the Παιδαγωγὸς at the opening of the play,
to the πρωταγωνιστὴς or principal performer, the second per·
former might represent the other live characters, and the Παι-
δαγωγὸς at his second appearance, withont any inconvenience.
As Medea speaks for a considerable time without being seen,
the circumstance ol her voice being heard (v. 96.) before the
Παιδαγωγὸς has been sufficiently long off the stage to change
his dress, is immaterial. In the Alcestis, we may assign to
the first actor the parts of Apollo, Admetus, and the man-
servant; and to the second, the parts cl Death, Alcestis, Her-
cules, and Pheres. The maid-servant might be represented
by either of them. At the conclusion of the play, when Al·

cestis is brought back to Admetus by Hercules, she preserves
the most obstinate silence, to the green admiration of her hus-
band. The poet attempta to assign a reason for her silence
(v. 1147.), but we believe the true cause to have been, that
