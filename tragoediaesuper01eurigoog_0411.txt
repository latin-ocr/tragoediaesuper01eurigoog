not conduct his mother to the mansion of AEgeus, but takes
her behind the scenes, where she changes her dress, and soon
afterwards returns in the habit and character of the Theban
herald. The corripetitors for the prise of tragedy at Athens,
like the competitors for the prize of equine velocity at New-
maritet, were cotnpelled to observe several regulations, which
were instituted for the purpose of preserring some degree of
equality in their performances. The actors were not only as-
signed by lot to the several competitors, but the number which

each competitor was allowed to employ was limited to three. ·
See Hesychius v. Νέμεσις ὑποκριτῶν. In mnsequence of this
regulation, when three characters were already on the stage, a
fourth could not be introduced without allowing one of the
three actors sufficient time to retire and change his dress. As
the actors were not allowed to eilge away ot the top, lihe the

confidant of Tilburina, it was always necessary to furnish the
performer, whose services were required in a new capacity,
with a decent reason for retiring. Thus, in the OEdipus Colo-
neus 0f Sophocles, Ismene goes away to offer sacrifice at
v. 509, and returns in the character of Theseus, after about
forty lines, during which interval OEdipus and Antigone re-
mainan the stage. Soon afterwards, (v. 847,) while OEdipus,
Creon, and Antigone, are on the stage, Antigone is violently
carried off by Creon's attendants, aad returns as Theseus after
about the same interval as before. It may be observed that,
in this play, as in several others, it is impossible to distribute
the parts for the three actors so as to give the whole of each
part to the same actor. Theseus, at his second appearance,
cannot choose but be adifferent individual from his first repre·
sentative. In the same play, OEdipus, Antigone, Ismene, and
